# Boris Bikes

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

Can you use a test-driven approach to write object-oriented code?
